Static landing page built with the Gatsby static site generator and React. Responsive layout and all that fun stuff (if you can call css fun).   
The pricing/availability data and image order for the gallery are pulled from a REST API I also wrote, to let the owners control the content somewhat.   

There is a crude dashboard I made for them in about 2 hours using CRA, so I'm not going to show it here ðŸ˜‚.
