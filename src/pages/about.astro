				Hi!
			</p>
			<p>Thanks for checking out my website. I'm not very good at talking about myself, but I'll give it a
				go.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Being a massive technology nerd, I've been fascinated by computers from a very young age. When it was
				time
				to go to university, I was still not very confident in my decisions and despite wanting to pursue
				Computer Science,
				my parents convinced me to "get a real profession" ðŸ˜‚, so I went to university for Chemistry, which I
				also enjoyed in school. While working on my bachelor's thesis at University of Patras in Greece
				(it was on computational/theoretical/quantum chemistry), I realised that I really don't want to do that
				for a living and got a little sad ðŸ˜”. I really liked programming, but I couldn't care less if X molecule
				could theoretically exist in some conditions Y blah blah...
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				So after spending a few months studying web development, I got an opportunity to come to the Netherlands
				and
				study Computer Science at Radboud University, which I was very excited about.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've spent a lot of time exploring different programming languages and technologies, mostly focused on
				full stack
				web development and it only keeps getting more and more fun, so I was certain that I want to make a
				career out of it. Not just to pay my rent, but also because I want to be the best developer I can be,
				and
				I feel like working in a professional environment with other developers who have different levels of
				experience
				than me is one of the best, if not the best way to achieve that.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				So here I am, finally feeling confident enough in my skills to look for a job. Wish me luck! ðŸ˜Š
